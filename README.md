The project aims to analyse the sentiment and response of the population of India towards the imposition of Hindi as the national language of the country. 

To do this, the project analyses the political context of the issue, takes a sampling of tweets and analyses it for bots, sentiment and geolocation. This was a final project done for CS-2378 New Geography of the Information. 

I was responsible for scraping tweets, cleaning the data, getting bot scores of the users, analysing the sentiment of the tweets, performing regressions on the data, and analysing the results.

The final project is named PranavIyengar_FinalProject.pdf

The code can be found in the code folder, along with the final spreadsheet of all the data scraped and cleaned.
